This is a small web project that generates text using a Markov chain.  
It is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and runs fully in the browser.
## https://yrxkush.github.io/Markov-txt-generator/

## What this project does
- Takes any input text and learns word-to-word transitions.
- Generates new text based on those transitions.
- Shows a graph of all nodes and links.
- Displays the transition table with probabilities.
- Show restart markers when the chain resets.
- Shows the interactive state diagram for easier visualization of the system’s behavior.

## How to use
1. Open `index.html` in any browser.
2. Paste or type a long input text.
3. Click “Build Markov Chain”.
4. Give the Number of Words and Paragraph to Generate.
5. Click “Generate Text” to see the output.
6. Explore the diagram or open the transition table to see all states.
