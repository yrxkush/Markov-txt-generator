## What this project does
- Takes any input text and learns word-to-word transitions.
- Generates new text based on those transitions.
- Shows a graph of all nodes and links.
- Displays the transition table with probabilities.
- Supports dark mode and restart markers when the chain resets.

## How to use
1. Open `index.html` in any browser.
2. Paste or type a long input text.
3. Click “Build Markov Chain”.
4. Give the Number of Words to Generate between 5 to 500.
5. Click “Generate Text” to see the output.
6. Explore the diagram or open the transition table to see all states.

## Files
- `index.html` – main file which include both css and js code.


## Notes
This project is made for learning, experimenting, and understanding how Markov chains generate text.  
It works entirely on the frontend and requires no installation.
